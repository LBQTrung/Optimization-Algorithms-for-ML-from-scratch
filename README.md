# Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning from Scratch

Welcome to the "Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning from Scratch" project! This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of optimization algorithms implemented entirely from scratch. The goal is to offer a clear and educational resource for understanding the inner workings of these fundamental algorithms used in the field of machine learning.

## Overview

Machine learning models heavily rely on optimization algorithms to find the optimal parameters that minimize (or maximize) a certain objective function. While popular machine learning libraries often provide pre-built optimization tools, delving into the implementation details of these algorithms can deepen your understanding of how they work.

## Key Features

- **From Scratch Implementations**: All optimization algorithms included in this project are coded from scratch, allowing you to explore the core concepts and mathematical foundations behind each algorithm.

- **Educational Resources**: Alongside the code, you'll find detailed explanations, comments, and references to relevant literature. This makes the project suitable for both beginners seeking to understand the basics and experienced practitioners looking for a quick reference.

- **Versatility**: The implemented algorithms cover a range of optimization techniques, including gradient descent variants, evolutionary algorithms, and more. You can easily adapt and integrate these algorithms into your own machine learning projects.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply explore the contents of the repository. Each algorithm is organized into its own directory, containing both the source code and supporting documentation. Feel free to clone the repository and experiment with the code in your own machine learning projects.

## Support Us
